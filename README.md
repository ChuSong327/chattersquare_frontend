### Installing
```javascript
npm install
```
### Run Locally
For backend:
```javascript
npm start
```
### Deployment
The app's front-end and back-end are deployed separately to Heroku. 
Due to Same Origin Policy, CORS is required to enable the front-end server to get access to the backend server, which is integrated in the project already.

### Furthur Info About the App
* To sign in the app, enter any combination of "user" and a number from 0 to 99, such as user32; no password is required for now. Or click Demo button to autofil the username and then sign in.
* Sign up feature will post the entered data into the database, so be cautious with what is entered.
* When sign in/sign up the app for the first time, it may take a few seconds for it to respond becuase Heroku puts the app's backend to sleep after 30mins of inactivity.
* The app is still in development, therefore, features such as user login authentication and direct message are not available yet.
